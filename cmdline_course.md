## Course Description

This course is an introduction to command line use both for basic everyday tasks and text processing. The course can be completed fully online, but live sessions and Slack-chat were a huge help during this adventure. I am also grateful for additional material on topics with a lot of very useful links to different online courses and other resources, a lot of them end up in my bookmarks and plans for future endeavours in Linux world.

Though I like digital note-taking but found that an old-school small paper notebook for writing down commands and their specifications worked best for me as I did not need to switch apps while watching or reading study material. Of course I will transfer everything to digital as soon as I have some spare time between other courses.

## Week 1 Introduction to Command Line Environments

This was an easy start for me as I did not need any additional preparations to get to a command line. Moreover, I have already done some small stuff using it.

We started with some pretty basic commands for everyday use. I knew some of them, but the need to repeat them for dozens of times during videos and tasks actually engraved them in me :) Tab and arrows use saved me a lot of typing (and nerves) for the whole course duration.

Incomplete list of studied commands:
- pwd
- ls and tree
- cd
- mv and cp
- cat and less
- mkdir
- rm and rmdir
- wget

... and a bunch of ways of quitting programs or processes.
